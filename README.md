# vaccination-prediction

This project uses [Data Driven's Flu Shot Learning Competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/ ) as a starting point for analysis into vaccine prediction using data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. 

The goal of this project is to (1) attempt to build a model that can predict if someone received their H1N1 and Seasonal Flu vaccines. And (2) to use this model, along with data analysis and visualization using PowerBI to determine which factors have the greatest influence on someone's decision to get their vaccines.

The hope in performing this analysis is that this information can be useful in aiding future Covid-19 vaccine efforts. If not, the project itself speaks to the kind of work I'd like to do/ efforts I would like to contribute to.


**Navigating This Repository**

In the **Visualizations** folder are two files: a pdf and PowerBI file (same content, different extensions) offering data viz and analysis on the best selected features from my modelling/analysis in python. 

In the **Modelling-Analysis** folder are a collection of csv files for model building/testing, including the features and labels from the dataset, as well as 'vaccination-prediction.ipynb'. In this file, I perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Analysis, Data Wrangling/Preprocessing, Feature Engineering and Selection, and Model Selection / Hyperparameter Tuning / Evaluation on prediction task. 

I have also included a write up (txt) file which summarizes my findings so far.

Enjoy :)

Please note: this project is ongoing, so this write-up summarizes my findings
only thus far.

---- Modelling and Analysis in Python ----

In my modeling and analysis of the data, I used a MultiOutput Classifier,
with a Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier as the base estimator, to 
classify a validation set from the overall dataset. This meant predicting 
if a person received their seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1 vaccine (multi label).

The best performance my model attained attained was as follows (broken down 
between H1N1 and seasonal flu prediction respectively):
		
	Accuracy_seas : 80%
	Accuracy_h1n1 : 74%

	f1_score_seas : 0.74
	f1_score_h1n1 : 0.51
	
	roc_auc_seas  : 0.74
	roc_auc_h1n1  : 0.71

The best performing set of features, chosen by embedded Random Forest selection,
were: 
 
 'h1n1_concern',
 'doctor_recc_h1n1',
 'doctor_recc_seasonal',
 'health_insurance',
 'opinion_h1n1_vacc_effective',
 'opinion_h1n1_risk',
 'opinion_h1n1_sick_from_vacc',
 'opinion_seas_vacc_effective',
 'opinion_seas_risk',
 'opinion_seas_sick_from_vacc',
 'age_group',
 'education',
 'race_White'

Although the 'race_White' feature made the cut for best features, I found that 
the data was composed primarily of white respondents, which may affect model 
performance adversely when classifying future respondents who aren't white 
(though I would have to test this to be sure). This doesn't represent sampling
 bias, however, as the distribution of race in the dataset was actually closely 
representative of race percentages in the US, at least according to wikipedia 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States). 

I also found that the model performed slightly worse for h1n1 than seasonal prediction.
In later data analysis, I found that one of the most important, possibly the most
important, feature for predicting h1n1 vaccination was actually seasonal vaccination.
Therefore, I'd like to go back and work on predicting seasonal vaccines first, then
using this information for h1n1 predictions. 



---- Data Visualization and Analysis in PowerBI ----


Page 1 / Dashboard 1

In this dashboard, I am showing some basic stats calculated from the dataset.
More specifically, I show the percentage of the sample that received both
their H1N1 and Seasonal Flu vaccines. Perhaps more importantly, I show that
that those who received their Seasonal Flu vaccine were significantly more 
likely (about 5x) to get their H1N1 vaccine. Its hard to say if this would
generalize to the Covid-19 vaccine, but it is very promising to see that
these two facts were so highly correlated.

In this visualization, I essentially shine the spotlight on the influence of 
doctors, specifically in offering recommendations to patients. The reason for 
this is that doctor recommendations showed a very high correlation to
the h1n1 and seasonal vaccine columns (in both Pearson correlation analysis 
from Python analysis as well as PowerBI 'Key Influencers' chart). I am showing
here that respondents were much more likely to get both vaccines given they
had a doctor recommendation. We can also see from the charts that there is 
a positive correlation between doctor recommendations and perceived risk of
both h1n1 and the seasonal flu. This is especially important in considering
the Covid-19 pandemic, where we have seen a decline in perceived risk of the 
virus, at least among younger age groups. Given how important a role doctors
play, however, we find that from the survey the majority of respondents 
reported having no doctor recommendation.

The final visualization is a side-by-side breakdown of feature/factor influence
for h1n1 and seasonal flu vaccines. The point of this dashboard is to explore 
which features (among the best selected features from the Python analysis) are
not only most highly correlated, but have the greatest influence on vaccine
predictions being true.  


----------
CONCLUSION 
----------

Overall, I found that the biggest predictors of vaccination (for both vaccines)
were doctor recommendations, perceived effectiveness of the vaccine, and perceived
risk from the virus' themselves. Although there are more factors at play, I see
these as a great starting point for extending this research to Covid-19. First
and foremost, the data suggests that people trust the opinion of healthcare
professionals. Therefore, video chats, phone calls, and emails from doctors 
encouraging their patients to not only be vaccinated, but explaining the 
risk of the virus and their trust in the vaccine could potentially go a long way.
Information surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic has entered the realm of politics 
as well as social media, making it suseptible to misinformation and emotionally
charged statements. In many ways, this makes dealing with Covid-19 alot more 
complex than the data from this project may be able to explain. However, I 
find this to be a very promising approach to future efforts to encourage
vaccination, as well as a great launch point for future research in this field.
